 * while the WASI syscall path is synchronous, so guest names cannot be
 * mapped 1:1 onto OPFS names at syscall time. The backend owns the whole
 * directory it is given instead:
 *
 * - `.uwasi.data.<id>`: one content file per guest file, each held open
 *   through a sync access handle for the backend's whole life. Releasing a
 *   handle is unsafe, because re-acquiring one is async.
 * - `.uwasi.meta.0/1`: namespace snapshots mapping guest names to data
 *   file ids, alternating between the two slots with a generation number
 *   and a checksum, so a torn snapshot falls back to the previous one.
 * - `.uwasi.meta.log`: the change log on top of the newest snapshot. Each
 *   namespace change appends and flushes one record, so its cost does not
 *   grow with the namespace; the log is folded into a fresh snapshot once
 *   it outgrows the last one. A torn append loses at most that change.
 * - a bounded pool of spare data files with open handles, so creating a
 *   guest file is a synchronous claim.
 *
 * Other entries in the directory are ignored and left untouched.
 *
 * Creating more files than the pool holds still succeeds: the record maps
 * the name immediately and the physical file follows on the next event
 * loop turn. Until it does, `fd_sync` reports `NOSPC` rather than claiming
 * durability it cannot provide, and `settle()` clears the backlog.
 *
 * Unlink destroys the content before it records the name removal, so a
 * crash leaves at worst an empty file, never live content under a name the
 * record no longer maps. While fds are still open, destruction defers to
 * the last `closeFile` (dangling-fd semantics) and only the record is
 * written. Rename over an existing target records the new mapping first,
 * which keeps the replacement atomic, then reclaims the replaced content.
 * Re-init rebuilds the namespace from the record alone, so unreferenced
 * data files are reclaimed rather than resurrected.
 *
 * Limits: hard links are refused with `NOTSUP`, as are changes naming a
 * device node (see `involvesDevice`), inode numbers and timestamps are
 * not persisted, and the store needs exactly one live backend, since sync
 * access handles are exclusive locks.
